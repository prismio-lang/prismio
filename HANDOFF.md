# Handoff — continuing the Prismio work

Read `COMPILER_AUDIT.md` (defects, all closed) and `V1_GAP_ANALYSIS.md` (capability inventory
against the v1 bar, with a status box at the top) before starting. Current as of **2026-08-01**.
Don't re-derive what's in them.

## Current state

Everything below is verified, not asserted — the commands that verify it are in the next section.

- **Self-hosts to a fixed point.** Bootstrapping from the committed seed produces a compiler whose
  IR for `src/main.psm` is byte-identical to the warm build's.
- **56/56 tests**, of which 16 are negative and each asserts *which* diagnostic it expects.
- Backend is the **LLVM C API** (`runtime/llvm-api-backend.c`); the old text emitter is gone.
  `ir_append()` survives only as a loud failure guarding against raw text creeping back in.
- Pinned to **LLVM 22.x**, enforced at build time (`tools/setup_llvm.py`) and at runtime
  (`LLVMGetVersion` in the backend). Bump `PRISMIO_LLVM_EXPECTED_MAJOR` (`runtime/prismio_llvm.h`)
  and `REQUIRED_MAJOR` (`tools/setup_llvm.py`) together.
- **CI on three platforms**: source-list check → LLVM → bootstrap from seed → fixpoint → suite →
  seed target-neutrality.

### File roles

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `src/lexer.psm` | tokens with spans, string/char escapes |
| `src/parser.psm` | precedence, casts, compound-assignment desugaring, error recovery |
| `src/sema.psm` | type checking, ownership, scoping, flow analysis |
| `src/types.psm` | TypeInfo, width/signedness helpers |
| `src/ir.psm` | AST → backend calls. **Emits no IR text** |
| `src/bridge.psm` | the backend FFI surface |
| `src/diag.psm` | the diagnostics FFI surface |
| `runtime/ir_symbols.c` | interned names, scoped symbol table, move/borrow state, loop targets |
| `runtime/diagnostics.c` | source-file registry, span rendering, error accounting |
| `runtime/llvm-api-backend.c` | the backend |
| `runtime/prismio_llvm.h` | LLVM C API decls; real headers via `-DPRISMIO_LLVM_REAL_HEADERS` |

## Workflow — do this for every change

```powershell
.\tools\bootstrap.ps1 -Compiler build\<lastgood>.exe -Out build\next.exe
.\tools\bootstrap.ps1 -Compiler build\next.exe -Out build\next2.exe
.\build\next.exe  build src\main.psm -o build\a.ll
.\build\next2.exe build src\main.psm -o build\b.ll
# a.ll and b.ll must be identical -> fixpoint
```

```bash
cd tests && PRISMIO=../build/next2.exe python test_runner.py   # must stay 56/56
```

Then, only for a language or codegen change the seed must carry:
`.\tools\refresh_seed.ps1 -Compiler build\next2.exe`, followed by a cold start from it
(seed → gen0 → gen1 → gen2, and gen1/gen2 must agree).

If you touched anything in `runtime/`: `python runtime/generate_embedded_sources.py`.
If you added or removed a file in `runtime/`: `python tools/check_source_lists.py` will tell you
which of the six lists you missed.

### Five rules learned the hard way

1. **Keep known-good generations.** A broken compiler can be unable to build the fix to its own
   bug — this happened: `scope1.exe` mishandled a global and so couldn't compile the correction.
   Recovery was to build from the previous good generation. Never overwrite your only good binary.
2. **Two generations before judging.** A change to code the compiler uses *to compile itself* only
   takes effect in the generation after next. Gen N has the new source; gen N+1 is the first built
   *by* it. Both short-circuit and `char_code` needed this.
3. **The suite is a floor, not proof.** It was 36/36 green while `for` with a string literal was
   completely broken. Add a regression test with every fix.
4. **Write `.psm` files with an editor/tool, not shell heredocs.** The shell mangles backslashes —
   `'\0'` in a heredoc reached the file as a literal NUL byte, twice, in this session alone. And
   PowerShell's `-Encoding utf8` writes a BOM (the lexer skips it now, but other tools won't).
5. **A check that cannot fail is worse than no check.** `verify_separation` looked for strings the
   backend stopped containing when it moved to the C API; half of it passed for the wrong reason
   and half would have failed. When you change what something is made of, re-read what tests it.

## What's next

**The memory model, Level 1.** Level 0 landed on 2026-08-05: `prismio aif <source.psm>` runs AIF's
inference engine over the post-sema AST, assigns every allocation site a tier, and emits the
manifest. It changes no codegen — nothing allocates differently yet — which is why it could land
without risking the self-host.

| | |
|---|---|
| `src/aif.psm` | the pass: AST walk, transfer rules, tier derivation, manifest |
| `runtime/aif_support.c` | its containers: bitsets, interning, points-to keys, the solver loop |
| `tools/aif_differential.py` | holds it against `aif/prototype/aif.py`, the independent oracle |
| `tests/aif_tiers.psm` | one fixture per SPEC §4.2 clause, asserted in the suite |

Run `python tools/aif_differential.py` after touching either implementation. They agree today on all
eight sources under both collection settings, and that agreement is the only thing standing between
a subtly wrong transfer function and a silently wrong tier. A deliberate divergence is fine and
should be commented at the site in both files; an accidental one fails the script.

Level 1 is T0 — stack-promote non-escaping structs — and it is where codegen starts to move. It
needs `ir_alloc_stack` hoisting to the entry block, and it needs codegen to be able to *look a tier
up*, which is the AST node ids `aif/implementation/COMPILER-AUDIT.md` §4.1 proposes and Level 0 did
not need.

Below is the seam as it was assessed before any of this; it is still accurate, and
`aif/implementation/COMPILER-AUDIT.md` §3 explains why it covers half the ladder rather than all
of it:

- `ir_alloc_object(struct_name)` and `ir_free_object(value)` are the only two places codegen
  allocates or releases anything.
- Both call whatever `ir_set_alloc_function` / `ir_set_free_function` name, defaulting to
  `malloc`/`free`. Declared in `src/bridge.psm`, so the frontend can drive them.
- Changing the model is therefore a change to those two policy hooks, not to codegen.

Things the memory model will want to settle, all of which are currently open:

- `String`, arrays and lists are **never freed**. Only structs are move-only, so only structs
  participate in ownership at all.
- Arrays are stack allocations, which is why returning one is rejected. If arrays become heap
  values, that restriction can be lifted — `sema_statement`'s `RETURN_STATEMENT` case is where.
- There is no `defer` and no scope-based drop; `drop(x)` is explicit and move-checked.
- **Do not add a pointer-keyed length cache to `str_char_at`.** It was considered and rejected
  precisely because it assumes string buffers are never freed and their addresses never reused —
  an invariant the memory model is about to break. The lexer got its speed from holding the
  length in the `Lexer` struct instead, which assumes nothing.

**Then the docs** (`../docs`), deliberately deferred until after the memory model so they are
written once against a settled language. `V1_GAP_ANALYSIS.md` §3 lists what the site currently
claims that the compiler does not implement.

### Known gaps, documented rather than fixed

- **Compile time is superlinear** in module size — ~290 ms for the 155 KB compiler, ~500 ms for a
  105 KB single module. The cubic term is gone (symbols are mangled once, type names resolve
  through a registry) and lexing is linear now, but sema still scans the module per identifier
  for function lookup. The fix is a name→declaration map built once in `analyze_module`.
- **No `-g`.** Nothing compiled can be source-debugged. Needs real DWARF design work.
- **No error-handling story.** The one users hit first: failure can only be signalled by a
  sentinel return value. Needs tagged unions → `Option`/`Result`, i.e. language design.
- **No generics, methods, closures, or slices.** `List<T>` is a hardcoded special case.
- `resolve_imports` flattens every module into one AST. File identity survives on each node's
  `file` id, which is why diagnostics can still name the right file — but there is no module
  namespacing or visibility.
