    `src/aif.psm` used to carry a comment asserting this invariant held by

    codegen at eight points -- stack promotion, arena placement, scope drops,
    container element disposition, refcounting, struct-field release, cycle
    collection, and field order. Every one of those changes what is emitted.

    So the invariant is a property to test, not to assert. `--debug` is SPEC
    7.2's level as a budget of zero rounds: the same engine runs and records the
    same pins, but nothing is proved, so widening puts every value at its top
    tier. This asserts what 7.1 actually requires -- **identical observable
    output** -- across every value fixture in the suite.

    `max` is deliberately not offered. With today's engine it would be
    byte-identical to `release`: the bounds it raises are never reached on this
